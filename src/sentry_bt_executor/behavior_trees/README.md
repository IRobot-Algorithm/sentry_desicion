Sequence:
A Sequence ticks all its children as long as they return SUCCESS. If any child returns FAILURE, the sequence is aborted.
Fallback:
If a child returns FAILURE, tick the next one.
If a child returns SUCCESS, then no more children are ticked and the Fallback returns SUCCESS.
If all the children return FAILURE, then the Fallback returns FAILURE too.
